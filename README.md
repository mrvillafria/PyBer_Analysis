# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to pull and merge data, perform calculations, and create dataframes to uncover trends. To visualize our findings, we will be using Python's two-dimensional plotting library, Matplotlib. Matplotlib will allow us to graph our complex data findings and present them in a meaningful and engaging way. With Matplotlib, we can show data as a line chart, bar chart, scatter plot, bubble chart, pie chart, and box-and-whisker-plot. Using graphs is important in telling our story because the audience will be able to quickly observe patterns and trends to make decisions.

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's analysis was to perform an exploratory analysis for PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company. There were two data sets that we sorted through, city data and ride data. We merged these data sets to show relations between city types, number of drivers, number of riders, and fares between January 2019 through April 2019. There are three different types of cities that we based on analysis on: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. After we grouped the data by city types and perform calculations, we created visualizations. We first created a ride-sharing summary dataFrame and then designed a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. This analysis will help PyBer improve their ride-sharing services and allow decision makers at PyBer to evaluate their business across all types of cities.
